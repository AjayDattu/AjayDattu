## About Me

I'm **Dattu Ajay**, a Fullstack Developer from India who enjoys building scalable, modern, and user-friendly web applications. I work with technologies like React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Material-UI, Bootstrap, and React Native on the frontend, while using Node.js, Express.js, Python, and Flask for backend development. I have experience with databases such as MongoDB, MySQL, Firebase, and Supabase, and I frequently work with AWS services including S3, Lambda, Rekognition, and EC2. I also integrate secure payment systems using Stripe and PayPal. I focus on writing clean code, optimizing performance, and delivering smooth user experiences. Currently, I’m building **Memoa**, a productivity platform, while deepening my knowledge of Supabase, AWS workflows, and scalable payment integrations.
