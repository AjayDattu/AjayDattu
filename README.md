## About Me

I'm **Dattu Ajay**, a Fullstack Developer from India passionate about building scalable, high-performance web applications with clean architecture and intuitive user experiences. I work across modern frontend technologies such as React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Material-UI, Bootstrap, and React Native, and I specialize in building reliable fullstack systems using Node.js, Express.js, Python, and Flask. My database experience includes MongoDB, MySQL, Firebase, and Supabase, and I actively work with cloud platforms like AWS (S3, Lambda, Rekognition, EC2). I also integrate secure payment systems using **Stripe** and **PayPal**, and build production-grade features with strong attention to performance and user experience. Currently, I’m developing **Memoa**, a productivity-focused platform, while expanding my skills in Supabase, AWS workflows, and scalable payment integrations.
